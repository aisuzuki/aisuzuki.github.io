    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      <code>Jekyll</code> is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator
      perfect for personal, project,
      or organization sites. Think of it like a
      file-based CMS, without all the complexity.
      <code>Jekyll</code> takes your content, renders Markdown
      and Liquid templates, and spits out a
      complete, static website ready to be served by Apache,
      Nginx or another web server.
      <code>Jekyll</code> is the engine behind GitHub Pages,
      which you can use to host sites right
      from your GitHub repositories.
